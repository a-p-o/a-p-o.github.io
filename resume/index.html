<p><strong>TransUnion (formerly iovation)</strong>
<em>Software Engineer (Feb. 2019—Present)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://newsroom.transunion.com/transunion-completes-acquisition-of-iovation/">I joined iovation shortly after they were acquired by TransUnion.</a>
I work on a team supporting our bread-and-butter systems (<a href="https://www.iovation.com/fraud-detection-prevention/fraud-prevention">FraudForce</a>) and on new systems (<a href="https://www.iovation.com/fraud-detection-prevention/surescore">SureScore</a>) which differentiate iovation from its competition.
These are large scale, high volume, highly available (99.9% uptime, 100 millisecond response time) systems.
So far, I have been recognized for demonstrating flexibility, resilience, teamwork, collaboration, goal-driven experimentation, and risk-taking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add new business rules</strong> so our customers can identify and prevent fraud in real-time.</li>
<li><strong>Add support for multiple machine learning models</strong> for our SureScore product, in real-time!</li>
<li><strong>Migrate multiple services to a Kubernetes environment</strong>, and deliver those services using a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
This decreased our release times (including all the planning, but not testing and development) from eight hours down to two hours.</li>
<li><strong>Respond promptly to issues raised by our security team</strong> by upgrading dependencies and patching our services.</li>
<li>Maintain legacy SOAP APIs.</li>
<li>Contribute to and maintain services publishing to and consuming from ActiveMQ queues.</li>
<li>Test code with JUnit 4, JUnit 5, Mockito, and Gatling.
Gatling helps us identify when our changes would have increased response times so that we can fix those issues before releasing to production.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/iovation_at-iovation-were-proud-to-help-empower-women-activity-6562437144202346496-iaSp">Assist hosting company events to empower women</a> in the workplace in the tech industry.</li>
<li><strong>Work closely with DevOps engineers and QA engineers</strong>.
When the team is constrained for capacity, I am able to pick up the slack and release changes to production or test changes made by the other developers on the team.</li>
<li>Plan and organize using the <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Provide and receive feedback with a collaborative attitude</strong>.
I know how to communicate effectively to help my team meet stakeholder expectations and <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/">reduce toil</a> so we can release changes as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Present and demonstrate new features to stakeholders.</li>
<li>Monitor production systems and respond to issues.
I am familiar with on-call rotations and can respond effectively to production issues to meet our SLOs.</li>
</ul>
