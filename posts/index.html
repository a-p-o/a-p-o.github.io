        <p>
            I care about the environment, so I do not litter. I like to believe most people are like this, but I still see litter in every neighborhood of Portland, OR. When my team and I visited Tokyo to present at Connected Ink 2020, I was impressed by how clean the roads and sidewalks are in Tokyo. I had heard of this aspect of Japanese culture, but it was amazing to experience in person.

            Why do you care? You probably don&rsquo;t. This is mostly for me to reflect.
 My current beliefs Decided  The top three traits I seek in a candidate are: integrity, leadership, and effectiveness. I am strongly convinced that the electoral college should be abolished and we should switch to a ranked voting system. The government should increase environmental regulations to prevent climate change and provide more incentives for alternative energy production.

        <p>
            Background I attended Women Who Code Portland&rsquo;s Design Study Night Online: Accessibility Design Principles and Strategies. I learned a few things. I have known some basics for years now, like always set the alt text.
What I learned Color contrast is important. There are tools that measure contrast. WebAIM has a great contrast checker.
Structure is (more) important (than I thought). I know better than to use an h1 just because I want large text.

        <p>
            Background I am in the fortunate position of having an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) available to me. The popular advice is to wait for the buy, then turn around and sell. I always told myself I would follow this advice. I didn&rsquo;t. Here is what I should have done.
 2 July: Let the ESPP execute: buy $6,867.72 ÷ ($87.04 × 85%)1 = 92 stocks ($6,806.528) 6 July: Sell stocks at opening price 92 × $88.

        <p>
            Choosing to consume a plant-based diet can be inconvenient. The greatest inconvenience might be finding a quick bite wherever you are.
I am vegan and worked at Chipotle last year. It is my duty to help you master ordering food at Chipotle.
First off, if you are anxious, I recommend ordering online. You can pick everything you want and get it when you are ready without having to wait through the line.
