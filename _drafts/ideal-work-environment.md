Work environments are important to software developers.
When we craft apps for the majority of the day, small factors such as distance to the bathroom can add up.
Below, in no particular order, I describe my ideal work environment.

# Location

The office building is in a city.
I work remotely on occasion.
The building is near a variety of food markets which offer many vegan food options.
The restaraunts offer vegan fare for take-out.

# Building

## Bathroom

The bathroom is between 25 and 40 feet away from my office.
This is a good distance, because it allows me to walk a small distance, but also not worry about walking too far just to use the bathroom.
Also, 25 feet should be far enough to not be distracted by the traffic headed to and from the bathroom.

Either everything or nothing in the bathroom is automatic.
The only way to dry one's hands is by using a paper towl.
There is some nice indie music playing at a reasonable volume.

## Kitchen/Cafeteria

The kitchen is somewhere on the same floor as my office.
It is not as close as the bathroom. 
The kitchen is minimal.
There is a fridge, a coffee maker, recycling cans, a sink, and a table large enough for five or six coworkers to snack and chat.

Noteably, there are two microwaves.
One for food containing animal products and one for food without.

# Office

I have a prviate office room.
The office contains my workstation, 

The office area is quiet.
The air conditioning is silent.
There is no ambient music.

In my office I have a small couch.
I work long days for few days of the week, so I often take naps on the couch.
I complete boring tasks while lounging on the couch.

# Workstation

## Desk

The desk is an automatic adjustable standing desk.
It is long and deep, allowing enough realestate for the machine (minus the tower), monitors, keyboard, and mouse described below.

## Chair



## Machines



### Desktop



#### Monitors



#### Keyboard



#### Mouse



### Laptops

There are two additional laptops.

#### Laptop 0

Laptop 0 is my favorite laptop.

#### Laptop 1

Laptop 1 is really just for taking to meetings.
I work on it from the couch and the communal area.
